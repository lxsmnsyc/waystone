[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/waystone.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waystone) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) [![Open in CodeSandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodeSandbox-blue?style=flat-square&logo=codesandbox)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/LXSMNSYC/waystone/tree/main/examples/demo)

## Install

```bash
npm i waystone
```

```bash
yarn add waystone
```

```bash
pnpm add waystone
```

## Usage

```js
import 'waystone';
```

**NOTE**: Waystone is required to only run once, so it's ideal to serve it on JS files where the module is going to be instanciated once.

### Replace instead of Push

You can use `ws:replace` to replace the History state rather than push when navigating

```html
<a href="/my-page" ws:replace>My page</a>
```

### Scroll control

By default, anchor tags will scroll up instantly to the top of the page when navigated to. You can add `ws:scroll="none"` to preserve scroll or you can use `ws:scroll="smooth"` if you want the page to scroll up smoothly.

### Prefetch strategies

You can add one of the following attributes to your anchor tags prefetch strategies:

- `ws:animation-frame`: Prefetches through `requestAnimationFrame`
- `ws:delay="1000"`: Prefetches through `setTimeout`
- `ws:idle`: Prefetches through `requestIdleCallback`
- `ws:interaction`: Prefetches when the element receives focus, is hovered or about to be touched.
- `ws:load`: Prefetches after the current window has loaded.
- `ws:media="(orientation: portrait)"`: Prefetches using media query
- `ws:ready-state="interactive"`: Prefetches using `document.readyState`
- `ws:visible`: Prefetches when the element is visible in the viewport

### Opting-out

You can add `ws:disabled` to your anchor element.

```html
<a href="/my-page" ws:disabled>My Page</a>
```

### Lifecycle Events

Waystone provides lifecycle events through `on`.

```js
import { on } from 'waystone';

on('unload', () => {
  cleanupStuff();
});
```

Waystone lifecycle involves three steps:

- `beforeunload`: This is called before `unload` happens. In this event, you can cancel the navigation by calling `event.preventDefault()`

```js
on('beforeunload', (event) => {
  const prompt = window.confirm('Are you sure you want to leave?');

  if (!prompt) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
})
```

- `unload`: This is called before the document is replaced.
- `load`: This is called after the document is replaced.
